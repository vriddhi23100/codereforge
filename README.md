# CodeReforge — Rebuild Your Logic

An interactive debugging and visualization platform that forces novices to think before they run, trace before they fix, and learn by diagnosing, not by copying.

## Features

- **Predict Before You Run**: Users must predict code behavior and manually trace execution before running
- **Visual Execution**: Step-by-step visualization of code execution with variable tracking
- **Discrepancy Detection**: Highlights differences between user predictions and actual execution
- **AI-Driven Socratic Mentoring**: AI-generated questions that guide learning without giving direct answers
- **Concept Learning Cards**: Animated cards that summarize learned concepts

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Monaco Editor** - Code editing
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Radix UI** - Accessible UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Groq API** - AI mentor questions (configurable to OpenAI)
- **Lucide React** - Icons

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your AI provider configuration:

**For Groq (recommended, free tier available):**
```env
AI_PROVIDER=groq
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

**For OpenAI (alternative):**
```env
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
```

> **Note**: The AI mentor feature will work without an API key, but will use fallback questions. To get Socratic questions generated by AI, you'll need to provide an API key.

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

```

## How It Works

1. **Predict**: User sees buggy code and must predict output and trace execution manually
2. **Run**: Once prediction is submitted, code execution is unlocked and visualized step-by-step
3. **Learn**: System highlights discrepancies and asks Socratic questions to guide understanding
4. **Fix**: User edits code to fix bugs and learns concepts through the process
